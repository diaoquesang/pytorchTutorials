## Basic Tutorials for Pytorch Learning😎😎😎

This tutorial was created on 2023/7/31. Almost all the code has corresponding comments, to help beginners understand dataset, dataloader, transform packaging, preliminary experience of the process of tuning the parameters, the initial grasp of the use of libraries such as opencv, pandas, os, numpy, etc., 😋 and get involved in the 【Handwritten Digit Recognition Project (pytorchTutorial)】 and 【CNN Intelligent Vehicle Patrol Task (pytorchCNNTutorial)】 (we simplified some dataset-related operations in order to reduce the amount of code). Enjoy the whole process of running Pytorch!❤️❤️❤️

The dataset and pre-trained model for 【CNN Intelligent Vehicle Patrol Task (pytorchCNNTutorial)】 is available on https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/datasetdetail/233057
